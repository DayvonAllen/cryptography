## Caesar-Cipher
- It is a private key encryption(symmetric encryption) method
- It was first used by Julius Caesar over 2000 years ago
- It is a type of substitution cipher: we shift every single letter in the plaintext with a fixed number of letters.
- The key itself is the number of letters we use for shifting
- First we assign numerical values to every letter in the alphabet to be able to use mathematical operations during encryption/decryption
- Encryption algorithm:
  - `E(x) = (x + n) % 26`
  - We have to consider all the characters in the plaintext
  - `E(x)` is the encrypted letter of the original `x` letter.
  - We have to shift the given letter with `n`(where `n` is the key)
  - Why use `% 26`? The size of the english alphabet is 26 which means there are 26 letters in the english alphabet.
  - We want to make sure the encrypted letter is within the range of `[0, Size Of the Alphabet]`, so the is why we use `% 26`
- Decryption algorithm:
  - `D(x) = (x - n) % 26`
  - We have to consider all the characters in the plaintext
  - `D(x)` is the decrypted letter(x is the letter in the ciphertext).
  - We have to shift the given letter with `-n`(where n is the key)
  - Why use `% 26`? The size of the english alphabet is 26 which means there are 26 letters in the english alphabet.
  - We want to make sure the encrypted letter is within the range of `[0, Size Of the Alphabet]`, so the is why we use `% 26`
- Can use bruteforce against this not a good encryption technique.
- Can also use `frequency-analysis`(we can analyze the frequency distribution of the letters)
  - For example in english text some letters are more frequent than others(E, A, O, I and T)
    - We can analyze the ciphertext and based on the most frequent letter in the ciphertext we can predict the key(so the number of shifts)
