## Caesar-Cipher
- It is a private key encryption(symmetric encryption) method
- It was first used by Julius Caesar over 2000 years ago
- It is a type of substitution cipher: we shift every single letter in the plaintext with a fixed number of letters.
- The key itself is the number of letters we use for shifting
- First we assign numerical values to every letter in the alphabet to be able to use mathematical operations during encryption/decryption
