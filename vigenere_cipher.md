## Vigenere Cipher
- It is very similar to the Caesar crypto-system, but we use several keys instead of just a single key.
- `Vigenere crypto-system` is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.
- It is a form of poly alphabetic substitution method
- very easy to understand and to implement
- It was constructed in the 16th century, and it was thought to be unbreakable.
- It tries to fix the problem with caesar cipher(there are so few possible keys for the english language, 26)
- Vigenere cipher uses a given word as the private key
  - Ex. key = `Secret`(the letters in the key have to be converted into integers first)
- The numerical representations of the letters in the key define how many characters to shift the actual letter in the plaintext.
- Instead of using a single value as the key(like caesar cipher), we have as many values as the number of letters in the private key.
- Size of the keyspace = 26^<size of the key>
  - Ex. key = `Secret`, keyspace = 26^6(because "secret", is 6 letters)
- Encryption:
  - `E<sub i>(x<sub i>) = (x<sub i> + K<sub i>) % 26`
  - We have to use the same formula as caesar cipher
  - `x<sub i>` is the actual letter in the plaintext
  - `E<sub i>(x<sub i>)` is the encrypted letter in the ciphertext
  - In Vigenere cipher we have to use the `i-th` letter of the ket for encrypting the `i-th` letter
- Decryption:
  - `D<sub i>(x<sub i>) = (x<sub i> - K<sub i>) % 26`
  - We have to use the same formula as caesar cipher
  - `x<sub i>` is the actual letter in the plaintext
  - `D<sub i>(x<sub i>)` is the decrypted letter in the ciphertext
  - In Vigenere cipher we have to use the `i-th` letter of the ket for encrypting the `i-th` letter
